This is what I usually have for lunch nearly every day, as I have the priviledge of working from home these days. It gives me the warmth of soup, the ease of noodles, greens I sorely lack otherwise and… meat.

Here’s one I made earlier with tat soi – it’s the stem base in the middle :-)

The chili part is optional.

The reasoning on the meat is to use a meat that has a strong flavour of its own. Chicken doesn’t really cut it.

Likewise, if you do a vegetarian variation, look for something with a stronger taste to take the meat’s place. Beans and veg stock may not work quite so well, perhaps mushrooms (I eat neither beans nor mushrooms, so I can’t say…)

Time

    Preparation: 5min
    Cooking: 5-10min

Ingredients

* 1/2 tsp ginger powder (or 1 tsp chopped ginger)
* 1/2 tsp garlic powder (or 2 cloves chopped garlic
* 1 tsp chili powder (or chili oil. optional)
* some chopped coriander
* 1 Tbsp of sesame oil
* 2 Tbsp dark soy sauce
* 1/4 beef stock cube (variation: use lamb or ham cube)
* 1 or 1/2 frying steak (variation: lamb [legjoint cut or steak] or gammon)
* 1 bundle of noodles (enough for one person)
* 2 spring onions
* 1 head of pak choi (variation: tat soi, or cavolo nero; all are fairly mild-tasting cabbage-type produce. I personally dislike normal cabbage)
* 40-50 cL boiling water (approx 1 cup)

Utensils

1 small pot, 1 frying pan, 1 chopping knife, 1 chopping board

Method

* Add spices, oil, soy and crumbled stock cube to cold pot
* Chop up the vegetables coarsley, add to pot
* Break up the noodles a bit (or not, as you wish) and add to pot
* Add boiling water to pot and turn on the heat. Water should be just enough to cover a half-inch over the ingredients, though remember that the noodles will absorb some of that. Simmer.
* Whilst this is simmering, start frying the meat. If beef or lamb, you could try doing it rare – if you dare :-)
* Once meat is cooked to liking, transfer to chopping board to rest it a couple of minutes
* Once noodle soup is done, transfer to bowl
* Slice meat into small/bite-size strips, and layer on top of noodle soup in bowl
